    "# Introduction \n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide a simply and easy to use tool to extract geometry features from 1D sufraces printed by additive manufacturing methods. This notebook accomplishes the following tasks \n",
    "- imports STL data of 1D surfaces (3D scan data required to this)\n",
    "- Identifies the surface of the 1D object and tresholds the surface to extract the printed track \n",
    "- Calculates geometry metrics including track width, height, and volume as well as the roughness metrics (Please not that roughness metrics are hightly dependent on the resolution of the 3D scan data)\n",
    "- Visualizes and outputs 2D contour images of segmented tracks as well as the appropriate geometry infomation. \n",
