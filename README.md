# High Throughput AM

Directed energy deposition (DED) based additive manufacturing tools which are broken down into the following categories: 
- high throughput design of experiment generation for single track deposisitions using either latin-hypercube sampling or user uploaded DOEs.
- High throughput bulk sample generation for either cicular substrates or rectangular substrates, with sizes, and parameters defined by the user through a simple CSV upload
- Gcode generation for the above DOE generations to enable the user a direct data - print pipeline
- DED optimization through single melt track analysis
  - 3D scan generation (STL format) from 3D point cloud data
  - Analysis software providing geometry information for single tracks including roughness metrics
